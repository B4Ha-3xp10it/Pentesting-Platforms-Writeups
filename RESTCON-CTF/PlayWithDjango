DJANGO is a python web-framework.

In the chall we are given a findme.zip, extracting it gives us a find me dir, which is actually a server that can be hosted, with bunch of folders and python file.

The challenge was suppposed to be solved by hosting the server onto the local machine and look for the source code review
But after trying the conventional method, I then realised that if I have the flag is on the server I just had to look for it in one of files
on the directories itself:

So looking for something I found "index.html" 

PATH ----> /findme/core/templates/core/index.html

SOURCE CODE OF index.html
================================================================================================
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HOME</title>
</head>
<body>
   
        {% ifequal user.username "sudo" %}
        	<h1>intr0_t0_djang0</h1>
        {% endifequal %}

<script>
    console.log("creating a super user account in django might help you..")
</script>

================================================================================================

inside the <body> tag there is some unusual text

{% ifequal user.username "sudo" %}
        	<h1>intr0_t0_djang0</h1>
 {% endifequal %}

intr0_t0_djang0 is the flag.

Creating admin privileges on the server was just a trick!.

Flag format : RESTCON{<- flag -<}
